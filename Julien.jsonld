Every ADA from the treasury is a shared resource, contributed by the community, and should be treated with the utmost care. I aim to support projects that demonstrate a strong potential for delivering measurable benefits, whether through technological advancements, community growth, or ecosystem enrichment.\n\nPrevent Scams and Dodgy Projects: Protecting the ecosystem from malicious actors is critical. I will prioritize thorough due diligence to identify and reject projects that show signs of dishonesty and lack of transparency."
